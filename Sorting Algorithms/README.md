|Sorting Algorithm|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Bubble Sort|This simple sorting algorithm works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. <br>After the first iteration, the maximum element goes to end (its correct position). After k passes, the largest k elements must have been moved to the last k positions.|
|Insertion Sort|This simple sorting algorithm works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. <br>It is like sorting playing cards in your hands. You split the cards into two groups: the sorted cards and the unsorted cards. Then, you pick a card from the unsorted group and put it in the right place in the sorted group.|
|Selection Sort|This comparison-based sorting algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and swapping it with the first unsorted element. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.|
