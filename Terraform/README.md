Terraform configuration files come with file extension .tf 

Terraform commands

terraform init - Initializes the working directory, downloads the necessary provider plugins, and sets up the backend for state management.

terraform plan - Creates an execution plan, showing you exactly what actions (create, update, or destroy) Terraform will take before any changes are made to your actual infrastructure.

terraform apply - Executes the actions proposed in the plan, provisioning the resources in your cloud provider. You will be prompted to confirm the action.

terraform destroy - Used to tear down all the infrastructure resources managed by your Terraform configuration when they are no longer needed, which is useful for testing or cleaning up experimental environments. 



FUTURE PLAN

Create github project in github for practicing AWS services. implement cloud security engineering concepts and gain experience on security architect responsibilities.
1. learn terraform to practice infrastructure as code. 

Practice coding questions and study DSA concepts for software engineering roles. 

Create a mock application (daily journal or note taking idea) to 
1. implement CICD concepts using GitHub Actions
2. use docker/kubernetes to implement webserver, database, network firewalls, load balancers to learn system design concepts
